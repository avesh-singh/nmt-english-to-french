# Neural Machine Translation - English to French
Pytorch implementation of English to French Neural machine translation model.

It is a basic Encoder-Decoder RNN with GRUs implemented on pytorch. Heavily inspired from [this tutorial.](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html)

Please check other branches of this repo as well. I have implemented several improved versions of this model.
Feel free to fork this repo and extend this solution.
